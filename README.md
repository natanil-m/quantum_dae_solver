# Quantum Differential and Algebric Equation Solver (QDES) - **Under Development**

**Note: This project is still under development, and the associated paper is not yet complete.**

## Overview

Quantum computing holds immense potential for solving complex differential equations (DEs), offering innovative approaches to overcome longstanding computational challenges. This project extends existing methods and presents a comprehensive framework for leveraging quantum computers in DE problem-solving. We provide an overview of previous approaches, highlighting the need for an improved and more versatile framework. Additionally, we intend to share our codebase as an open-source framework, facilitating future research endeavors.

## Introduction

The solution of differential equations plays a pivotal role in various scientific and engineering disciplines, but traditional computing approaches can be limited in handling complex DEs. Quantum computing promises a new era in DE problem-solving by harnessing the power of quantum superposition and entanglement to explore multiple paths simultaneously. Our research aims to further develop this field by providing a robust and adaptable framework.

## Key Features

- **Quantum Advantage**: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach DEs, offering the ability to explore solutions more efficiently, especially for high-dimensional and non-linear equations.

- **Comparative Analysis**: We will review existing methods and approaches in DE problem-solving to highlight the unique advantages of quantum computing.

- **Open-Source Framework**: We released our codebase as an open-source framework to encourage collaboration and further research in this field.
